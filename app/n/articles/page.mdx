I have been leading editorial teams as well as doing my own writing for over two decades. 

### Publishing

In the 2010s, the company that owned the domain MINING.com wanted to monetize it. The site was a portal, but it had a limited audience and not much interest from advertisers. 

Following the same model as Business Insider and Huffington Post, MINING.com became a digital-native news site. While competitors were focused on maintaining their print business, MINING.com dominated the digital space as reading habits shifted. MINING.com became the leading news site in the resource sector. The site had over 1.2 million pageviews and a massive email list of 500,000 subscribers. The traffic attracted major advertisers like Caterpillar and Exxon, who were also shifting to digital platforms. 

### Editorial

I led editorial teams at both MINING.com and Kitco Mining. MINING.com was a Canadian Online Publishing Award (COPA) winner. A reporter from the team was also a Jack Webster Foundation finalist. 

Kitco Mining was a COPA finalist.
