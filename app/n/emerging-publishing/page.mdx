Artificial intelligence is a gamechanger. The interface and user experience is just too good. Niche publications supported by ads just has too much fricton and frankly bad and uneven UI to make the effort worthwhile. The landscape for AI is competitive. All the services are fighting for share, and the services keep getting better. 

So where is media headed? 

**Incumbents** - If you have a big brand with a subscribers, you are pretty firmly entrenched. If you are buying news from New York Times, it is going to be hard for anyone else to compete. 

**Niche** - All the substackers will find niche audiences. The subscriber model is firmly entrenched. 

**Personalities and the rise of video** - The internet is nearly a hallway of mirrors. Media companies are increasingly relying on AI, which drives audiences to seek out real people. Shows that are driven by real guests who are engaging are the winners. Podcasts work, but video is better, since seeing the guest is better. Video succeeds when you are not doing remotes. Rather, the person is in the studio. Note Joe Rogan. 

**Writing for myself** - What you are reading is an effort to help me understand the industry I work in. It is useful to me to put down my thoughts. The same goes for all experts in a variety of fields.
