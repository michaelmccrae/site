Michael McCrae is a media leader with 20+ years of experience uncovering emerging trends and driving revenue growth. Michael has an MBA and CMA. 

Michael was co-founder and publisher of MINING.com. In the 2010s, the owners of the MINING.com lacked a business model to monetize the domain. Following the same path set by Business Insider and Huffington Post, MINING.com became a digital-native news site. While competitors were focused on maintaining their print business, MINING.com came to dominate the digital space as reading habits shifted and became the leading news site in the resource sector. The site grew to over 1.2 million pageviews and a massive email list of 500,000 subscribers. The audience was valued by advertisers. Clients included Fortune 500 companies like Exxon and Caterpillar.  

As an anchor, Michael has conducted over 100 CEO interviews. Highlights include [Barrick Gold's Mark Bristow](https://youtu.be/obpqsDveJdY?si=itJGWQtR24RWieem), [Newmont's Tom Palmer](https://youtu.be/mbFUyG32jSQ?si=3ga_uIQFq9rtzOC7), [Lundin Mining's Adam Lundin](https://youtu.be/8pr-Ds5mK90?si=yQcfbcNcUfXkkcAC), and [Jigar Shah, director of the Loan Programs Office in the US Department of Energy](https://youtu.be/l3vL8tCdgIs?si=q9mMlFknrmePlub7).

<div className="text-right italic text-sm text-gray-400 mt-4">"At MINING.com, Michael has built one of the most impressive natural resources websites in just a few years. The man works tirelessly to grow his publication, sets high standards for his writers, and motivates them to create their best work."</div>
