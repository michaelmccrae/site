# On Anchoring

<AnimatedName />

I have conducted over 100 on camera interviews with resource CEOs. I have also given talks and moderated panels. 

<Randy />

Interviewees have ranged from junior mining CEOs to Fortune 500 executives, from metal analysts to authors. 

<Keith />

Interviews include Newmont's Tom Palmer, Ludin Mining's Adam Lundin, and Barrick Gold's Mark Bristow.
